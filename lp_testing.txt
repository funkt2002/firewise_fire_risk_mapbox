We need to test our absolute LP. 

We need to:
1. Read in the parcels.shp data from the data folder. 
2. USe the raw values here (as seen else in the project) and calculate scores. (min max, robust min max, quantile, and normal) Use similar scoring techniques as seen in prpject.
Ask me qs about this to help. 
3. We want to test the absolute LP we have on each of these scoring types. We want to test contiguous, and non contiguous, random samples of parcels on each. 

We want to see an example output table of one of the tests, see the weight assigned to each variable, scores for each parcel, etc. 
Ask me what variables to use. 
make sure to output a .lp file for one of the solutinos (same as for example output), in same folder
Make plots of each dist for variables
